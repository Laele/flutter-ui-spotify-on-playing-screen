          'GRAMMY-nominated Marshmello\'s star continues to rise as the famously masked artist breaks boundaries across the industry. With chart-topping singles and collaborations with the likes of Juice WRLD, Halsey, Demi Lovato, Bastille, Kane Brown, Selena Gomez, Khalid, Jonas Brothers, and more, Marshmello has clocked a staggering 13 billion streams across Spotify alone. With over 40 million monthly listeners on the platform, he\'s one of the top 40 most streamed artists in the world on Spotify and the third-most- subscribed artist on YouTube. Featured on the cover of the Forbes magazine "30 Under 30" issue, Marshmello has proved to not only be an innovative producer, but a forward- thinking businessman. With his own brand of chocolate-filled marshmallows (“Stuffed Puffs”), he’s also launched a children’s entertainment channel, Mellodees. Marshmello collaborated with the Jonas Brothers on their early summers mash “Leave Before You Love Me,” which peaked at number 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 and was also nominated for the best dance / electronic album at the 2022 Grammy’s. Most recently, Marshmello teamed up with Khalid to release “Numb,” which has steadily climbed the Billboard Hot 100.',
      songLyrics: '''
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swing
Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the morning comes
When we see what we've become
In the cold light of day we're a flame in the wind
Not the fire that we begun
Every argument, every word we can't take back
'Cause with all that has happened
I think that we both know the way that the story ends

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

When the evening falls
And I'm left there with my thoughts
And the image of you being with someone else
Well, it's eating me up inside
But we run our course, we pretend that we're okay
Now if we jump together, at least we can swing
Far away from the wreck we made

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go
So I'll go, I'll go
I will go, go, go

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier
Even though I might not like this
I think that you'll be happier, I want you to be happier

Then only for a minute
I want to change my mind
'Cause this just don't feel right to me
I wanna raise your spirits
I want to see you smile
But know that means I'll have to leave
Know that means I'll have to leave

Lately, I've been, I've been thinking
I want you to be happier, I want you to be happier

          '''Diamond-certified American hitmaker Post Malone bridges the gap between the worlds of rap and the pop mainstream. Within five years of his debut, he went from underground genre novelty to certified superstar, amassing a string of Top Ten singles with a hybrid style that combined his unique vocal delivery, pained lyrics, and hip-hop production inspired as much by Tim McGraw as Kanye West. After the release of his 2015 quintuple-platinum single "White Iverson," off his debut, Stoney, he quickly ascended to the top of the pop mainstream in the late 2010s with a succession of multi-platinum hits that included chart-toppers "Rockstar" with 21 Savage and "Psycho" with Ty Dolla Sign from 2018's Grammy-nominated Beerbongs & Bentleys and one of the highest-certified singles in RIAA history, "Sunflower" with Swae Lee, from 2019's pop-leaning Hollywood's Bleeding. After dialing things back with 2022's vulnerable Twelve Carat Toothache, he made a further push into guitar-based pop with 2023's Austin. ''',

The last few months, I've been working on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him, you made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said, I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (ah)
If he mess up just a little, baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little, then come right back, girl, come right back
Gimme one chance, just a little, baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I should've loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you (held you, baby)
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay (never again, baby)

Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (uh)
Out of time, out of time
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come before you're completely engulfed
In the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed, free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name, but before you dwell in that house forever

You kinda feel like you're tryna get away from me
If you do, I won't move
I ain't just cry for no reason (reason)
I ain't just pray for no reason (reason)
I give thanks for the days, for the hours
And another way, another life breathing

          '''One of the most acclaimed artists of his generation, hip-hop or otherwise, Kendrick Lamar is known for his top-tier lyricism, virtuosic microphone command, and sharp conceptual vision. His talents have translated to a rare combination of continuous chart feats and critical acclaim, plus respect and support from the rappers who paved the way for his advancement. The Compton native started in his teens and hit his creative and commercial stride in the 2010s, during which he authored the multi-platinum good kid, m.A.A.d city (2012), followed up with the Grammy-winning To Pimp a Butterfly (2015), and scaled another new height with the Grammy- and Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN. (2017). All three displayed an unmatched mix of inventive wordplay and riveting narratives with an assertion of artistic dominance, examination of internal conflict, and upliftment of community all centered. Those qualities were also exemplified in seven concurrent Top 40 singles that included "Swimming Pools (Drank)," "i," and the Hot 100-topping "HUMBLE." Lamar's screenplay-level detail on those recordings was enriched by a shifting collective of associates, many of whom -- from inspirations  and  to peers such as Sounwave, , and  -- likewise represent Los Angeles. The rapper's cinematic and collaborative inclinations inevitably attracted the mainstream film industry, leading to an executive-production role on Black Panther: The Album (2018), the source of three additional Top 40 hits. Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers (2022), fueled by intense self-analysis, became Lamar's sixth number one on the Billboard 200 despite containing his most challenging and confrontational work. The lean surprise release GNX (2024) capped a year in which Lamar topped the Hot 100 again with "Like That" (a collaboration with  and ) and the Grammy-sweeping "Not Like Us" (the peak of a public feud with ).
